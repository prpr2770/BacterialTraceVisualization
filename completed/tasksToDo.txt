Tasks to do
----------------
1. plotting multiple time-series: voltage and calcium signals.
2. lineplot_transitioning - via chaining effects! : to indicate that there's an implicit change in scale and values occuring.


Just as you're providing divID to the plotMultiline.js,
design the code such that you provide the signal name you'd like it to extract from the cellData.
This takes care of the following:
1. the div inside which data shall be presented.
2. flexibility to choose the data_sig from within the data-set; so if the dataset has multiple signals to choose from,
that can be done.


HTML elemnets: Div's related to one set of signals shall be in one box.

For the multiline and singleline plots, give them classnames that are common, even for the other signals.
Differentiate betweent the types, based on the ID.
